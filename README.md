# Knife Spec

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/knife-spec.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/knife-spec) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sethvargo/knife-spec.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sethvargo/knife-spec)

knife-spec is a knife plugin that automatically generates Chef cookbook specs (tests) stubs when you create a new cookbook with knife.

## Installation

Add this line to your cookbook's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'knife-spec'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install knife-spec
```

## Usage

There are no usage instructions! Simply having knife-spec installed will automatically hook into Chef's default `cookbook_create` process to generate ChefSpec tests.

```
$ knife cookbook create COOKBOOK
```
